# WordSearchV2
Python program to find a phrase in a grid of characters.
The program reads a text file called "wordsearch.txt" for the grid of letters and will find inputted words from those letters. It works left, right, up, down, and diagonally from left to right only, right to left coming someday maybe possibly?
